## About me

Hi, my name is Julian Cantera, i'm a self-taught software developer from Argentina 🇦🇷.

### A 'byte' of history

In February 2020 I began to learning C++ and object-oriented programming and the same year I started developing a video game 🎮 using C#, Godot and Blender. 

After 9 months of development I learned a few things: 
- Blender is awesome.
- Trying to create a sandbox as your first project is bad for your health 😵‍💫.
- Quaternions are hell 🔥.
- I love writing code, but my current level is not enough.
- I need at least 4 years to finish this games.

At the end of 2020 I started to get curious about web development.

In 2021 I start to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Git and Java. In mid-July I started developing a Android database client using Java, JDBC and Android Studio.

In 2022 I continue studying Java and start learning Spring. I create a private project called BinaryArrayFormatFinder(BAFF) (an API using Java, Spring, SQL and SQLite), I deploy it on a VPS with ubuntu 1.8 and I publish it in an API market, three months later I delete it since I couldn't continue renting the VPS.

A month later I created a Spring project called BeerFinderNZ (using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript) for a coding challenge. The application allowed you to search for beer at the lowest price in different parts of New Zealand.

In July of the same year I find my first job developing a web store managed by an Android application for a clothing store, in February 2023 I finished the development of the web store but for reasons beyond my control the project was canceled.

Between March and April of 2023, I develop an application for Android tablets that allows storing product information and increasing the price of a large number of products, using filters and percentages, for the same clothing store.

From March until the beginning of July I developed an open source project called ShareYourFiles, a file storage and sharing service..

### Things i like

Games like Starboud, Kenshi, Mass Effect, X3, Fable ...
